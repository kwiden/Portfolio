About our theme: Weâ€™re Lemon Aid because I thought building a Lemon as a car would be hilarious. However, Lemon doesn't make for great announcing. We switched once we realized the additional potential of Lemon Aid (and how much better it rolls off the tongue). It allowed me to build a lemon _and_ use a silly pun. Win-win!
