"Widen your horizons" - A cheesy pun

### Who is this lady?
I am currently an Engineering and Computer Science teacher. I graduated from San Jose State University with a masters in teaching. Additionally, I'm a computer engineer with experience in embedded systems and robotics. I worked one some cool things like drones ([Iris Automation](https://www.irisonboard.com/)), graphic cards (NVIDIA), and classroom robotics ([VEX Robotics](https://www.vexrobotics.com/)).


### Wait, did you say robotics?
I've been involed in competitive robotics since high school, starting with FIRST Robotics Team 1675 in Milwaukee, WI. After graduating high school, I went to Iowa State University and co-founded FRC 3928. I mentored 3928 for three years before taking a break to focus on graduating and moved my efforts over to FTAing for FTC. After graduation I moved to Texas and mentored FRC 1296 for two years as well as volunteering at VEX events. After a move to California in 2018, I met and joined my local team, FRC 253. I've also volunteered at FTC events and VEX Worlds. 

I've added a lot to the robotics community - go look at my bylines for some examples.

### Any other hobbies?
In 2019, I fell in love with competing in [Power Racing Series](http://www.powerracingseries.org/) where competitors build and race electric go-karts. I share about my first build, "Lemon Aid," in the projects section. I also help out the Battlebots team, [Seems Reasonable](https://seemsreasonable.shop/) with the robots Tantrum and Blip.

### Beyond tech?
Besides the engineering stuff, I have a [very cute dog](https://www.instagram.com/gatsbypaws/) who accompanies me on backpacking and camping trips. I also enjoy creative pursuits such as painting, quilting and playing the harp.
