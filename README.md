# Who is Katie?
I'm a computer engineer with experience in embedded systems and robotics. Most recently, I worked at [Iris Automation](https://www.irisonboard.com/) on "sense and avoid" systems that prevent mid-aid collisions between industrial drones and other aircraft. I've also worked at [VEX Robotics](https://www.vexrobotics.com/) on products used by a million students worldwide.

I've been involed in FIRST Robotics since high school, starting with Team 1675 in Milwaukee, WI. After graduating high school, I went to Iowa State University and co-founded FRC 3928. I mentored 3928 for three years before taking a break to focus on graduating. After graduation I moved to Texas and mentored FRC 1296 for two years. In 2018, I moved to California and met local team, FRC 253.

Recently I fell in love with competing in [Power Racing Series](http://www.powerracingseries.org/). I share about my first build, "Lemon Aid," in the projects section.

Besides the engineering stuff, I have a [very cute dog](https://www.instagram.com/gatsbypaws/) who accompanies me on backpacking and camping trips. I also enjoy creative pursuits such as painting and playing various musical instruments.
