"Widen your horizons" - A cheesy pun

### Who is this lady?
I'm a computer engineer with experience in embedded systems and robotics. Currently I work at [NVIDIA](www.nvidia.com). Previous places I've been have [Orro](www.getorro.com) (smart home products), [Iris Automation](https://www.irisonboard.com/) (autonomous drone collision avoidance), and [VEX Robotics](https://www.vexrobotics.com/) (educational robotics).

As of March 2021, I am an [Encorps Fellow](https://encorps.org/) and have committed to transistioning to teaching.

### Wait, did you say robotics?
I've been involed in competitive robotics since high school, starting with FIRST Robotics Team 1675 in Milwaukee, WI. After graduating high school, I went to Iowa State University and co-founded FRC 3928. I mentored 3928 for three years before taking a break to focus on graduating and moved my efforts over to FTAing for FTC. After graduation I moved to Texas and mentored FRC 1296 for two years as well as volunteering at VEX events. After a move to California in 2018, I met and joined my local team, FRC 253. I've also volunteered at FTC events and VEX Worlds. 

I've added a lot to the robotics community - go look at my bylines for some examples.

### Any other hobbies?
Recently I fell in love with competing in [Power Racing Series](http://www.powerracingseries.org/) where competitors build and race electric go-karts. I share about my first build, "Lemon Aid," in the projects section.

### Beyond tech?
Besides the engineering stuff, I have a [very cute dog](https://www.instagram.com/gatsbypaws/) who accompanies me on backpacking and camping trips. I also enjoy creative pursuits such as painting, [quilting](http://www.etsy.com/shop/littledogrobotics) and [playing the harp](http://www.facebook.com/KatieOnHarp).
