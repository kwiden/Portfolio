# Q&A With Katie
You have questions, I have answers. Typically it goes the other way around.

I'm a computer engineer with experience in embedded systems and robotics. Currently I work at [Orro](www.getorro.com). Previously, I worked on "sense and avoid" systems that prevent mid-aid collisions between industrial drones and other aircraft at [Iris Automation](https://www.irisonboard.com/) and on educational products used by a million students worldwide at [VEX Robotics](https://www.vexrobotics.com/).

I've been involed in FIRST Robotics since high school, starting with Team 1675 in Milwaukee, WI. After graduating high school, I went to Iowa State University and co-founded FRC 3928. I mentored 3928 for three years before taking a break to focus on graduating. After graduation I moved to Texas and mentored FRC 1296 for two years. After a move to California in 2018, I met and joined my local team, FRC 253.

Recently I fell in love with competing in [Power Racing Series](http://www.powerracingseries.org/). I share about my first build, "Lemon Aid," in the projects section.

Besides the engineering stuff, I have a [very cute dog](https://www.instagram.com/gatsbypaws/) who accompanies me on backpacking and camping trips. I also enjoy creative pursuits such as painting and playing various musical instruments.
