Here are some "publications" that I have written or contributed to:

[Guide to FRC Scouting](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/your-scouts-hate-scouting-and-your-data-is-bad-heres-why/352340)
- A break-down of the often over-looked role of scouting on robotics teams, highlighting common problems that teams face. I address the symptoms and their root causes as well as provide tangible solutions.

[Guide to FRC Programming](https://kwiden.github.io/LetsLearnProgramming/)
- Also listed in projects. A tutorial series that takes students from 0 to Robot. By allowing students to learn at their own pace, I can better use my time as an instructor answering questions.

[Girl Powered](https://www.girlpowered.com/why-girl-powered/) 
- While at VEX Robotics, I was part of a team that created and maintained the Girl Powered initiative. Much of the copy on this page is my work.

[Interviewed by FRC team, Spectrum](http://blog.spectrum3847.org/2016/10/katie-widen-this-is-how-i-work.html)
- Interviewed by Houston-based FRC team, "Spectrum," for their "How I Work" series that features prominent mentors across FRC.

[Iris Blog Post](https://www.irisonboard.com/2019/04/09/educational-robotics-iris-and-you/)
- Blog post that describes my time mentoring while at Iris, shared on the company blog.
